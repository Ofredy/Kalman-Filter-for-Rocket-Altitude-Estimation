# Kalman-Filter-for-Rocket-Altitude-Estimation

The source used to generate this code is, KalmanFilter.net, an ebook created by Alex Becker.

I recreated the kalman filter for rocket altitude estimation from the python script provided by KalmanFilter.net. The purpose of this is to gain an understanding of the kalman filter and to implement the code in c++.
